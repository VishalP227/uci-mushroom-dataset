# Classifying Mushrooms from Agaricus and Lepiota Families

In this project we work with the UCI mushroom dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom), the goals of this project 
are as follows:

- Classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible with high accuracy (above 90%)
- Select a model with good F1 score (low false positives and false negatives)
- Explore and perform extensive feature engineering methods to identify the best features for classification
- Perform hyperparameter search for the models to be tested through cross validation to examine each modelâ€™s performance carefully.
- To identify the most common categorical features of poisonous mushrooms.
- Propose the best model with low computational complexity, high accuracy and F1 score and high scalability.
